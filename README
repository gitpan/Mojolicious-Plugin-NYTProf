NAME
    Mojolicious::Plugin::NYTProf - Auto handling of Devel::NYTProf in your
    Mojolicious app

VERSION
    0.03

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin enables Mojolicious to automatically generate Devel::NYTProf
    profiles and routes for your app, it has been inspired by
    Dancer::Plugin::NYTProf

SYNOPSIS
      use Mojolicious::Lite;

      plugin NYTProf => {
        nytprof => {
          # optional, will default to nytprof
          profiles_dir     => '/some_tmp_dir/',
          # optional
          nytprofhtml_path => '/path/to/nytprofhtml',
        },
      };

      app->start;

    Or

      use Mojo::Base 'Mojolicious';

      ...

      sub startup {
        my $self = shift;

        ...

        my $mojo_config = $self->plugin('Config');
        # where config contains the necessary keys as show above
        $self->plugin(NYTProf => $mojo_config);
      }

    Then run your app. Profiles generated can be seen by visting /nytprof
    and reports will be generated on the fly why you click on a specific
    profile.

METHODS
  register
    Registers the plugin with your app - this will only do something if the
    nytprof key exists in your config hash

      $self->register($app, \%config);

HOOKS AND Devel::NYTProf
    When the nytprof key is missing from your config (or commented out) none
    of the nytprof routes will be loaded and the Devel::NYTProf module will
    not be imported.

    The plugin adds hooks to control the level of profiling, Devel::NYTProf
    profiling is started using a before_routes hook and the stopped with an
    after_dispatch hook. The consequence of this is that you should see
    profiling only for your routes and rendering code and will not see most
    of the actual Mojolicious framework detail.
